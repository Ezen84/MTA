    <p>Jamaica Depot is home the Q3,Q4(my bus route-3 blocks off),Q5,Q17,Q30,Q84(also my bus route,)Q77,and Q85 bus routes.Most of them arent really that special, except for the Q5/Q85 and the Q3, which goes to the JFK airport.</p>

The routes for the Laguardia Depot are  Q18, Q29, Q33, Q39, Q47, Q67, Q69, Q72, Q100, Q101, Q102, Q103, Q104, with  them having two select bus serives and 3 express routes.</p>

<p id="#queens"><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mtanewyorkcitybusroster/new-york-city-bus-roster/queens-village-nus-depot" target="_blank"><img src="Images/Queens_Village.png" class="grow flex container"></a>Queens Village Depot is one that I had never had much experience with, only rode the Q27 to Murdock AV sometimes, but that's about it. Queens Village Depot is home to the Q1,Q2,Q20A(shared with casey setengel depot),Q27,Q36,Q43,Q46,Q83, and Q88 routes, as well as the X63,X64,and X68 for express routes.
